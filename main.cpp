 * Description | This program executes a "shunting yard algorithm."
 * The user enters a basic mathematical expression (+ - * / ^) with single-
 * digit integers and parentheses and translates it into postfix notation.
 * Afterward, it visualizes the postfix expression as a tree. The user can ask
 * to output their expression as infix, prefix, or postfix notation.
